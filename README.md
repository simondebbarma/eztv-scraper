The app heavily uses assets from TTY to beautify the interface.

Most of the app doesn't pass any values or parameters to each other. They simply take your selections and downloads the data you want.

This module parses the websites.

As there are over 6500 shows listed on EZTV, I've filtered the program to parse only the Top 500 show, as ranked by IMDb. You can easily change this in the `./lib/eztv-scraper/ui.rb` file, by changing the loop to the number of shows you want. If you want the app to parse the entire site, you need to change `500` to `all_shows`  and un-comment when we declare `all_shows`

The app goes through a sequence of methods to grab parse a new page, look for episodes, and downloads them into a file.

Here's how a JSON file looks like of the scraped page. The first item is a hash of details on the show, and every following item is a hash of every available episode.
